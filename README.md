## Background Information
Kiwanis Field is a ~$2 million fundraising effort to renovate the back field at a high school called Pauline Johnson Collegiate & Vocational School. This is an informational website for the project. I work closely with the organizers to maintain and create updates for this website as they work towards completion of the field this summer, I would love to hear feedback and improvement suggestions! 

## Technical Information
I created this static website from scratch (will have some dynamic features in the future) without a template or a templating system using very simple PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can see how easy it is to use PHP's include to have your header in one file, footer in another file and have them appear on every one of your pages basically creating a very simple templating system. I thought this maay be a good learning tool for beginners so I have uploaded the source codde here. Let me know if you have any questions!
