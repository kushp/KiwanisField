    <div class="BoxHeader">Kiwanis Field organizers dream big for community <span class="BoxHeaderSpanStyle">May. 25/2013</span></div>
		<div class="Para">It started as a field of dreams, but it's becoming reality.</div>
		<div class="Para">On Friday morning, the Kiwanis Field Committee officially launched a fundraising campaign that will help turn the back campus of Pauline Johnson Collegiate into an outdoor stadium open to students, the community, Special Olympians and the Hamilton Tiger Cats.</div>
		<div class="Para">"We put together the biggest project that we could and we essentially built our field of dreams and now we are moving toward it," committee co-chair Neal Stamer said during an interview. "It feels wonderful. The most important thing is the community support. It's not just the idea of the field of dreams, but the community's desire for the field of dreams."</div>
		<div class="Para">Once completed, the field will be the first synthetic turf, multi-use, non-sport specific athletic facility in Brantford and the County of Brant. The state-of-the-art facility will be host to numerous sports, including football, soccer, track and field, rugby, field lacrosse and regional, provincial and national-level athletic competitions.</div>
		<div class="Para">It will be a suitable host for Special Olympics and be a spot for Hamilton Tiger Cats practices, clinics and games.</div>
		<div class="Para">"(The Tiger Cats) have committed their annual black and gold game to Kiwanis Field upon completion of the facility and, to be honest, we are tremendously excited about getting to host that here," Stamer said.</div>
		<div class="Para">The field will include an eight-lane rubberized track, a synthetic turf field, multiple sets of permanent bleachers, light standards for night use, an electronic scoreboard and a field house with washrooms, a change room, storage, concessions and media centre.</div>
		<div class="Para">To date, the field committee has raised $1.28 million of its $2 million goal. Sponsorship has come in from throughout the community, including a $400,000 donation each from the Kiwanis Club of Brantford, Grand Erie District School Board and City of Brantford.</div>
		<div class="Para">"We recognize that this field will allow the Kiwanis Club of Brantford to provide opportunities to this community through sport, opportunities to build confidence, self-esteem, improve health and physical well-being and opportunity to develop life skills," said Crystal Glaves, past president of the Kiwanis Club of Brantford.</div>
		<div class="Para">Speaking on behalf of Mayor Chris Friel, Ward 5 Coun. David Neumann said the field would become "one of the jewels in the crown of the city."</div>
		<div class="Para">Not only that, the field is the first step in the city's revitalization of southeast Brantford, Neumann said.</div>
		<div class="Para">"We see this project as a catalyst to the renewal of this whole stretch along Colborne Street," Neumann said. "It does meet a lot of community and city objectives."</div>
		<div class="Para">The idea for the field was originally born as a way to revitalize the field for the school's use, using funds organizers hoped to win through the annual Aviva Community Fund competition.</div>
		<div class="Para">Initially called the Field of Dreams, the committee earned a large number of votes in the competition, but the idea wasn't chosen for funding.</div>
		<div class="Para">After speaking with Brant MP Phil McColeman and MPP Dave Levac, the committee decided to take the initiative community-wide.</div>
		<div class="Para">"Dreams are a powerful thing," McColeman said. "When the group came to discuss this project I think the thing that was most evident to both Dave and myself was the feeling that was in the room more than the words that were said. It was that palpable ether that was there that this was a project the community needed and these were the people to execute on this project."</div>
		<div class="Para">The Kiwanis Field Committee plans to fundraise throughout 2013 in the hope of beginning work on the field in early 2014 for a fall 2014 opening.</div>

    <div class="BoxHeader">Final fundraising push for Kiwanis Field <span class="BoxHeaderSpanStyle">May. 24/2013</span></div>
   		<div class="Para">Officials have launched the final phase of their fundraising campaign for a multi-sport facility at Pauline Johnson Collegiate in Brantford.</div>
		<div class="Para">1.3-million of the 2-million dollar Kiwanis Field project has already been raised for the synthetic turf field and eight lane rubberized track.</div>
		<div class="Para">The rest of the money is expected to be collected within the next 7 months.</div>
		<div class="Para">Kiwanis Field co-chair Melanie Kraemer says because of a field shortage in Brantford, this project will mean a lot for local youth.</div>
		<div class="Para">Kraemer says the Hamilton Tiger-Cats have also expressed interest in holding a future Black & Gold Game at the field, as well as youth football camps.</div>
		<div class="Para">Construction of Kiwanis Field is slated to begin next summer and the project is scheduled to be completed by September 2014.</div>

    <div class="BoxHeader">Kiwanis Field campaign launch set for May 24 at PJC <span class="BoxHeaderSpanStyle">May. 16/2013</span></div>
   		<div class="Para">It's a bold goal, but a project that will offer young athletes in Brantford a better future.</div>
		<div class="Para">Staff and students at Pauline Johnson Collegiate will gather on May 24 to officially launch the Kiwanis Field fundraising campaign.</div>
		<div class="Para">"With the Brantford Kiwanis Club, school board and city on board, we've already got three pretty great community partners," committee member and teacher Neal Stamer said. "We are hoping the rest of the community can get behind this in the same way."</div>
		<div class="Para">Once known as the Field of Dreams project, the proposed athletic complex has taken on the Kiwanis name after the club matched a $400,000 donation from the school board and city.</div>
		<div class="Para">The goal is to replace the worn and tired track and field facility behind the high school with a state-of-the-art synthetic turf and rubberized track.</div>
		<div class="Para">The finished product would also include permanent bleachers, lighting, a field house and an electronic scoreboard.</div>
		<div class="Para">With the three big donations and some smaller ones from local businesses, the project only needs another $700,000 to meet a $2 million estimated cost.</div>
		<div class="Para">"With any luck the campaign will last through the end of 2013," Stamer said. "We are looking to raise $700,000 in seven months, which we know is pretty ambitious, but we have a generous community."</div>
		<div class="Para">The committee will be explaining more about the project's importance and how the community can get behind the project at the May 24 news conference.</div>

    <div class="BoxHeader">Field of Dreams at PJ becoming reality <span class="BoxHeaderSpanStyle">May. 10/2013</span></div>
   	<div class="Para">An official fundraising kick-off for a $2-million turf, track and athletic complex at Pauline Johnson Collegiate will be held on May 24.</div>
	<div class="Para">Once called the Field of Dreams and now known as Kiwanis Field, the project already has financial commitment from the Brantford Kiwanis Club, the Grand Erie District School Board and the city, which are each contributing $400,000.</div>
	<div class="Para">With some additional donations from local businesses, almost $1.3 million in funding has been secured.</div>
	<div class="Para">"Our goal is to raise $700,000 by the end of the year," said Neal Stamer, a teacher at Pauline Johnson and one of the chairs of the fundraising committee. "We are lucky enough to live in a generous community."</div>
	<div class="Para">The Kiwanis Field will be built on just over three acres of land behind Pauline Johnson. It will include all-weather turf that will replace the existing soccer/football field, an eight-lane rubberized track, multiple sets of permanent bleachers, light standards for night use, a field house including washrooms and change rooms, an electronic scoreboard, and improvements to the parking lot.</div>
	<div class="Para">The facility will also be suited for Special Olympics events.</div>
	<div class="Para">Stamer said a committee has been meeting that includes representatives from potential users - among them the Special Olympics and the Brantford Track and Field Club - to ensure the facility "has what it needs to work for the community."</div>
	<div class="Para">Stamer said the all-weather turf means the number of days the field can be used increases significantly and the lighting means it is usable well into the night.</div>
	<div class="Para">"The plan is to have it open before school and up to 11 p.m," he said.</div>
	<div class="Para">Kiwanis Field will be the first synthetic turf, multi-use, non-sport specific athletic facility in Brantford and Brant County, said Stamer.</div>
	<div class="Para">"There are community groups that have needs that can't be accommodated in Brantford. They have to go to Burlington or Oakville."</div>
	<div class="Para">Speaking at a Kiwanis Club meeting on Thursday, John Forbeck, direction of education for the Grand Erie District School Board, said the board is promoting partnerships between the community and school system.</div>
	<div class="Para">Forbeck said the new athletic complex will serve some of the city's vulnerable communities.</div>
	<div class="Para">"An athletic track will engage students and make them want to come to school."</div>
	<div class="Para">The school board will take the lead on organizing the design and construction of the project. The board will also be holding in-trust funds generated by the field for future maintenance on the facility.</div>

        <div class="Para">
The Kiwanis Club and Grand Erie District School Board hope the City of Brantford will go the distance to make the proposed Brantford Field of Dreams sports facility at Pauline Johnson Collegiate a reality.</div>

<div class="Para">Kiwanis and the GEDSB have each committed $400,000 toward the $2 million project, a synthetic field and eight-lane track where youth and community groups could run track and play soccer, rugby, field lacrosse and football.</div>

<div class="Para">A representative from each organization appeared at Monday's city council committee of the whole meeting to ask councillors for a further $400,000 to move the project forward.</div>

<div class="Para">"Given Kiwanis' major emphasis on supporting children's projects, we see this as a good fit with our values and our goals," said Kiwanis president Bob Johnson.</div>

<div class="Para">Kiwanis' donation hinges on the school board and city buying in. GEDSB vice chair David Dean said the proposed Colborne Street East facility was an easy sell for the board. On top of its initial $400,000 donation, the board will cover future operating expenses and look after administration, including bookings.</div>

<div class="Para">Brantford is in "dire need" of a recreation centre in the city's southeast, said Field of Dreams vice chair Neal Stamer. If his group builds it, Stamer hopes youth from every ward will come to the multi-sport field, which will boost the city's image and help revitalize the area.</div>

<div class="Para">Coun. David Neumann is confident that the Field of Dreams would be well used and add "a spark of life" to the Echo Place neighbourhood, which has recently lost a bowling alley and grocery store.</div>

<div class="Para">"By partnering with the school board, we will ensure that this becomes… more than just a school facility, but a community facility," Neumann said.</div>

<div class="Para">The city would receive a $2 million facility for a one-time $400,000 investment without needing to manage or maintain it, Mayor Chris Friel noted. Friel endorsed the plan.</div>

<div class="Para">"I look forward to seeing this begin and really be a catalyst for a wonderful opportunity and a wonderful partnership," he said.</div>

<div class="Para">The facility would be open to boys and girls sports clubs and be accessible to athletes with disabilities. The Field of Dreams committee has asked the Brantford Galaxy Soccer Club, Brantford Track and Field Club and Brant and District Football Club for input into the facility's design.</div>

<div class="Para">Stamer said that, as of yet, the committee has not partnered with any post-secondary institutions, but talks continue.</div>

<div class="Para">The committee is looking for $250,000 in upfront city funding to secure the Kiwanis donation, with the balance to be paid out over three years.</div>

<div class="Para">Councillors directed staff to seek out an extra $250,000 and present a funding plan at the Sept. 24 city council meeting.</div>

   	<div class="BoxHeader">$400,000 sought for a 'Dream'  <span class="BoxHeaderSpanStyle">September. 10/2012</span></div>
            <div class="Para">City council will decide in a few months whether it will give $400,000 to support a so-called Field of Dreams, a $2-million all-weather turf, track and athletic complex at Pauline Johnson Collegiate.</div>
<div class="Para">On Monday night, members of council's community services committee got a presentation on what the potential project would include.</div>
<div class="Para">That list starts with an all-weather turf that would replace the Colborne Street high school's existing soccer/football field, followed by an eight-lane track surface that also would replace what exists there today. It continues with permanent bleachers, lights, a field house with washrooms, changing rooms, storage and concessions areas, an electronic scoreboard, fencing, and new signage.</div>
<div class="Para">The complex would be named the Kiwanis Field, recognizing the $400,000 commitment over a three-year period made by Kiwanis Club, contingent on other donations from the Grand Erie District School Board and the City of Brantford.</div>
<div class="Para">"The board will take responsibility for ongoing operating costs- field and facility maintenance, then the booking of the facility by community groups and partners," said Grand Erie board vice-chair David Dean said.</div>
<div class="Para">Dean answered a question later on the source of its funding, saying the board would take it from its annual facility renewal and maintenance allotment for Pauline Johnson.</div>
<div class="Para">In their comments, councillors supported the project while openly expressing concern over where the city's $400,000 share would come from. There was some confusion on this question as $150,000 was allocated for an all-weather turf football field somewhere in the city in the 2012 budget - though at the time the councillor who moved it be set aside was thinking it would be used by the Brantford Bisons minor football at North Park Collegiate.</div>
<div class="Para">"Football has been under-serviced forever- they have to go out of town for their house games," said Ward 3 Coun. Richard Carpenter. "That $150,000 was earmarked for football local use."</div>
<div class="Para">According to information given to council, the Bisons sit on the Field of Dreams committee and have had that sport's needs included in the Pauline Johnson complex.</div>
<div class="Para">With $400,000 from each of the local Kiwanis Club and school board and a potential $400,000 from the city, the remaining $800,000 would be raised through a community fundraising campaign.</div>
<div class="Para">Mayor Chris Friel noted this capital funding and operational setup is what the city is looking to get into on a more frequent basis.
"This would be a $2-million complex for $400,000, that we don't have to manage and maintain going forward," Friel said.</div>
<div class="Para">The report on where the $400,000 might come from is due back before council within two months.</div>
